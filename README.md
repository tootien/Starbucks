## Introduction
A dataset containing answers to a Starbucks Costumer Survey are analysed, with the main objective of understanding the characteristics of the recurrent clients of Starbucks and how they stand out of the non-recurrent clients of the brand. For this, some minor objectives can be defined, made in the form of questions:
* Who are the recurrent costumers of Starbucks? And who are the non-recurrent costumers?
* How these two classes of costumers are different from one another?
* What are the strong points of Starbucks according to the recurrent costumers? And the weakests?

## Conclusion
For this task, exploring data visually through a dashboard proves more effective than simply creating one. This allows for an easy overview of the relationships between different data categories.

With this approach, specific and detailed information about customers can be obtained. Firstly, from the initial exploratory data analysis, we can conclude that:

- Customers exhibit a good balance between male and female.
- The majority of customers are young, aged between 20 to 29, often employed or students with an income below RM 25,000.
- Spending per visit seems to be correlated with normal values, below 40 RM.

From the dashboard, several observations can be made:

- Customers are regularly grouped into two distinct categories: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly visitors.
- Daily visitors tend to make short visits, typically lasting no more than an hour.
- Weekly visitors have longer stays, ranging from 1 to 3 hours, and spend more per visit.
- Conversely, Monthly visitors tend to use the Drive-Thru, opting for normal values in each visit.
- Interestingly, more frequent visitors are associated with individuals living farther from the Starbucks store, contrary to occasional visitors who live nearby.
  
From the Quality Ratio analysis, it is evident that:

- Pricing levels are not significantly skewed towards the higher range, indicating customer dissatisfaction.
- Hence, the importance of sales and promotions for customers with a higher price range.
  
Based on these findings, we can propose some concise suggestions to generate ideas for increasing sales:
- Leverage Social Media for Sales and Promotions:
Engage with the predominantly young customer base by actively promoting sales and special offers through various social media platforms. This will tap into their interest in discounts and promotions, driving increased footfall.

- Create Student-Friendly Spaces:
Tailor the Starbucks environment to cater to the needs of the young demographic, particularly students and working individuals. Consider establishing locations near universities, providing a conducive atmosphere for both studying and enjoying coffee. This strategic approach can foster brand loyalty within this target group.

- Expand Reach with Convenient Services:
Recognizing a segment of customers residing farther from our stores, introduce initiatives like Drive-Thru sales and delivery services. By implementing promotional campaigns for household items, Starbucks can become a convenient and preferred choice for this customer segment, even from a distance.
- Optimize Takeaway Sales for Local Customers:
For customers residing closer to our locations, capitalize on their occasional visits by promoting and optimizing Takeaway Sales. Tailor promotions and offers that entice local customers to choose Starbucks for their takeaway coffee needs, contributing to increased sales frequency.
